# SNHU-CS-370-Project-Two
# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I worked on creating an intelligent agent that uses deep Q-learning to find the optimal path in a maze. The goal was to train the agent to reach a target (the treasure) while maximizing its rewards.
The assignment provided me with the environment and the basic structure for the game, which included the code for the maze layout, the experience replay, and the network model setup. I implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm. I added the logic to train the neural network by using experience replay, and balancing exploration and exploitation to achieve a high win rate.
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing algorithms and creating software using computers. It matters because they create new inventions and solutions, which lead to human advancements.
# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by first breaking them down into smaller steps, analyzing possible solutions, and implementing and testing code to find the best solution.
# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities are making sure that the software I create is reliable, fair, and respects users' privacy. Also, it is important to avoid biases and be transparent about how data is used. Finally, I must make sure that my work aligns with legal requirements, like GDPR, and helps the organization maintain trust with its users.
